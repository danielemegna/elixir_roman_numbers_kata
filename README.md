Elixir Roman Numbers Kata
======================

## About this Kata
This Kata was performed at XP2001 by Kent Beck. Here is [a video of Karl Scotland doing this Kata in Excel at agile 2008](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/TDD-Managers-Nicolette-Scotland) Here is [a video of JonJagger doing this Kata in Ruby using CyberDojo](http://vimeo.com/15104374)

Difficulty - Easy.

## Problem Description

The Romans were a clever bunch. They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years. They invented concrete and straight roads and even bikinis[1]. One thing they never discovered though was the number zero. This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today. For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programmes.

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets)

The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg

     1 --> I
     10 --> X
     7 --> VII
     etc..

For a full description of how it works, take a look at [this useful reference website](http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html): which includes an implementation of the Kata in javascript.
